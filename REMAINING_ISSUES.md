# Remaining Audit Issues

This document tracks audit findings from the original security & code-quality audit that have **not** yet been addressed. The Critical (Cn), High (Hn), and Major (Mn) items closed so far are listed at the bottom for context.

Last updated: 2026-05-18 (after N3/N4/N5 cleanup).

## Nitpicks (low priority, but worth tracking)

### N6 — Per-call `validation/` folder scans

- The orchestrator and dashboard both scan `validation/*.task.md` on every cycle / API call. Fine at current scale (dozens of files); will get hot if the project ever sees hundreds of in-flight subtasks.
- **Fix:** Cache the listing for the duration of one orchestrator cycle; invalidate on file-watcher events. Defer until performance actually matters.
- **Effort:** ~1 hr (and only worth doing if a hot-spot shows up in profiling).

### N7 — Dashboard endpoints collapse all errors to 500

- [dashboard/app.py](dashboard/app.py) — typical pattern: `except Exception as e: return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500`. Hides distinction between client errors (bad input → 400) and server errors (genuine bug → 500), and leaks internal error messages back to the browser.
- **Fix:** Narrow the catches: `ValueError` → 400, `FileNotFoundError` → 404, everything else → 500 with a generic message + a UUID logged server-side that the user can quote in a bug report.
- **Effort:** ~45 min.

### N8 — `requirements.txt` uses `>=` only

- `requirements.txt` and `rag_api/requirements.txt` both pin with `>=`. A `pip install` on a fresh machine in 6 months will pull whatever's current on PyPI — that's the route through which silent supply-chain compromises arrive, and the route through which "works on my machine" bugs arrive too.
- **Fix:** Pin direct dependencies to `==`. Generate a `requirements.lock` via `pip freeze` for the working set, check it in, and document the workflow ("upgrade with `pip-compile`, then commit the new lock").
- **Effort:** ~20 min.

### N9 — RAG API `Settings` uses raw `os.getenv`

- [rag_api/config.py](rag_api/config.py) — explicitly documented as "**not** `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`" because pydantic-settings isn't installed. That's fine, but the hand-rolled approach skips type coercion (every config value is a string until you `int()` it) and silently accepts typos in env var names.
- **Fix:** Either add `pydantic-settings` to `rag_api/requirements.txt` and use `BaseSettings`, or stay hand-rolled but add a `_REQUIRED_KEYS` sanity check at startup so a typo crashes fast instead of producing a confusing runtime error 20 minutes in.
- **Effort:** ~30 min.

### N10 — No resource limits on agent subprocesses

- [scripts/scheduler.py:70-83](scripts/scheduler.py:70) — agents are spawned with `subprocess.Popen` and no memory/CPU caps. A runaway LLM tool loop, a leaking ChromaDB client, or a coder agent that fork-bombs each other could wedge the host.
- **Fix:** On POSIX, wrap the agent entrypoint in `resource.setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS, ...)`. On Windows, use Job Objects via `psutil` or `pywin32`. Document in CLAUDE.md as a known limitation if the Windows path is too painful.
- **Effort:** ~1 hr (POSIX), ~3 hrs (cross-platform).

## Verification checklist

When closing any of the above, the following must remain green:

```
pytest tests/ -q       # currently 219/219 (1 environment-dependent flake in test_rag_injection.py)
```

For security-relevant changes (C1, N7), add a regression test under `tests/`. For the orchestrator split (M1), the existing `tests/test_orchestrator_helpers.py` is the safety net — every helper that moves must keep its existing test passing without changes to the test file.

| N1 | Magic numbers hoisted to module-top constants in `agent_orchestrator.py` | `d206e22` |
| N2 | Late `import re` hoisted to module top in `task_io.py` (+3 sites in `agent_orchestrator.py`) | `d206e22` |
| N3 | Narrowed 4 JSON-parse `except Exception` → `ValueError` in orchestrator. Audit confirmed remaining broad catches are intentional log-and-continue per CLAUDE.md error-handling pattern (3). | (pending) |
| N4 | Obsolete — closed by refactor. The dashboard no longer has an approval-detail modal or `approvalsCache`; approvals render inline with all needed metadata. No new endpoint needed. | n/a |
| N5 | `DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL` / `DEFAULT_CHAT_TIMEOUT_S` / `DEFAULT_CHAT_MAX_TOOL_TURNS` / `DEFAULT_RAG_BASE_URL` hoisted to module-top in `dashboard/app.py`; used in both config-loaded and outer-fallback paths. | (pending) |
